  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: poppins1
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
    - family: poppins2
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: poppins3
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
    - family: poppins4
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
    - family: poppins5
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
